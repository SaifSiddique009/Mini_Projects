Psedo Code
- I have two csv file, one constains some questions and answers, another contains multiple choice options for each questions. This two entity are linked with same id no. 
- I want to make an interactive quiz game in python. Where a player will prompt if they want to start the game or not. 
- Then if they agree, then the program will again ask them "Which version they want to play the game: Easy, Medium, Hard
- After selecting the version, one by one a question will come with four possible options. They have to give the correct answer. 
- If it is correct then a prompt with "Correct" message will show, otherwise "Incorrect, Correct Answer: " will be visible.
- Finally a score will be given to them and a status of how much knowledge they have.

To Do This, I have to 
- Read csv into two dict variable.
- Ask user first two prompt
- Randomly choose a number of questions and ask the user
- Give response on those answer, if incorrect provide correct answer, update score
- Finally display score and message.
